My name is Matthew Basista. I am currently a senior at the Elliott School of International Affairs (ESIA) at GWU studying international affairs. My studies concentrate on conflict resolution with a focus in the Middle East.   
I have worked with Operation GW VALOR in a variety of roles. Currently, I am working as part of a team to organize the 2017 GW Veteran's Day of Service, a collaborative project between the Honey W. Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, Operation GW VALOR, and GW Veterans (a student organization). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

* The Civil-Military Divide: Causes, Conflict, and Consequences   
* How Should the US Stabilize Iraq?  
* Genocide, R2P, and Humanitarian Catastrophes  
* The Growing Militarization of US Foreign Policy
* GW's Veteran Day of Service, Spring 2017
